  <p class="lead">You will be leaving feedback about your team members in <%= @group.name %>.</p>
  <hr class="my-3">
  <p>For each member, you will be asked questions about how much they participated in
  <%= @project.name %>, about the overall quality of their work, and about the number of
  disagreements you had with them throughout the project. You will also be allowed to
  leave additional comments.</p>
  
  <p>None of the feedback you leave here will be shared with the members of <%= @group.name %>.
  Only the instructors of this course will be able to see your feedback.</p>

  <p>Your feedback will be saved per-person, each time you hit the "Continue" button.
  You can also go back and edit your feedback later, if you wish, until the instructor
  marks the project as closed.</p>
